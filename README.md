# Backend for The Missing Middle's Platform
The Missing Middle Backend - with proper authentication and mostly Express setup. **Notice**: In active experimentation and development - NOT COMPLETE.

## Objectives
This version aims to harness the power of JWT for authentication and Socket.IO for real-time communication. Moreover, this version experiments with the Redis/Mongo database setup rather than NeDB.
